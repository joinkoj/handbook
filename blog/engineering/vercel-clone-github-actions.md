# Your own Vercel clone using GitHub Actions

My favorite feature of Vercel is the automatic branch and pull request deployments. You get a simple URL where you can test your site before merging a PR. Since Vercel is not free for organizations, we decided to experiment with building our own Vercel workflow clone using GitHub Actions and the static host [Surge.sh](https://surge.sh).
