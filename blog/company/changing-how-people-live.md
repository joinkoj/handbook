We live in a subscription economy. And while most industries adapted to this new reality there is one that stood still. The furniture industry is completely out of date. It has barely seen any change in the past decades. Consumers have to buy furniture the same way they did during the pre-internet era. They drive to a big furniture retail facility in the outskirts of a city. Roam the huge retail space for hours and return with a cheap, short-lasting bookshelf that they will have to replace a few years down the road.

At Koj we are convinced that it is time for a change. Our mission is to offer a better, more sustainable and cheaper alternative to traditional furniture retail.

This is the start of a new adventure. To find out more go to https://koj.co.
