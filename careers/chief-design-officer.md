# Chief Design Officer (CDO)

## Changing how people live

Koj is a well-funded, ambitious startup from Zurich, Switzerland. At Koj, we want to disrupt the furniture industry and change how people live by offering a better, more sustainable, and more affordable alternative to traditional furniture retail. With Koj, consumers get their apartment fully-furnished by a professional interior designer and rent high-quality furniture on a monthly subscription. Once they move out, Koj takes all the furniture back, renovates it, and the cycle repeats.

Great design is at the core of what we believe in. Hence, we are looking for a highly talented, hard-working, and wickedly smart [Design Lead/Chief Design Officer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6Srzcm8EEg&t=3s).
