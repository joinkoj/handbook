# Internship

**Internship - 12 Months - Full time**

## Internship at fast-growing tech startup

Koj is a well-funded, ambitious tech startup from Switzerland. At Koj, we want to disrupt the furniture industry and change how people live by offering a better, more sustainable, and more affordable alternative to traditional furniture retail.

Once they move out, Koj takes all the furniture back, renovates it, and the cycle repeats.
