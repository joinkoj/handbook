Koj Ltd. is a well-funded, ambitious startup from Zurich, Switzerland. At Koj, we want to change how people live by offering a better, more sustainable, and cheaper alternative to traditional furniture retail. With Koj, consumers gets their apartment fully furnished by professional interior designers and rent high-quality furniture on a monthly subscription. Once they move out, Koj will take all the furniture back, renovate it, and the cycle just repeats.

Dig what we are doing? Want to join our cause? We are always looking for highly-talented, hardworking, and wickedly-smart people! So, if you tick off at least one of the three boxes â€” send us an email to jobs+polymath@koj.co. Come on board and make a dent!
