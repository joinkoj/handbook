## Avoid private messages

When using Slack for work-related purposes, avoid private messages. [Private messages discourage collaboration.](https://blog.flowdock.com/2014/04/30/beware-of-private-conversations/) You might actually be contacting the wrong person, and they cannot easily redirect you to the right person. If the person is unavailable at the moment, it is less efficient because other people can’t jump in and help. Use a public channel and mention the person or group you want to reach. This ensures it is easy for other people to chime in, involve other people if needed, and learn from whatever is discussed.

If someone sends you a work-related private message, it is OK to let them know you’d like to take the conversation to a public channel, linking to this section of the handbook. The process might look something like:

> **In the private message:** Thanks for reaching out. That’s a great question/idea that I think the rest of the team could benefit from. I’m going to move this to #public-channel based on our desire to avoid private messages.

> **In the appropriate public channel:** @person asked "question" in a DM, pulling that out here if anyone else has input.

If you must send a work-related private message, [don’t start a conversation with “Hi” or “Hey”](http://www.nohello.com) because that interrupts their work without communicating anything. If you have a quick question, just ask the question directly, and the person will respond asynchronously. If you truly need to have a synchronous communication, then start by asking for that explicitly, while mentioning the subject. For example: “I’m having trouble understanding issue XYZ. Can we talk about it quickly?”.

## Send (and read) messages any time

Because Koj is an all-remote company with flexible work hours, teammates should feel free to send messages to others at any time, rather than trying to guess what a convenient time would be for the other party (or parties) involved.

However, a corollary to this is that they are free to read your message whenever is convenient for them. There is no expectation that people will be responsive over the weekend/vacation/evening/etc..

Make sure to set up Slack to only send you notifications when you want to see them!

## Channels

We have many Slack channels, and you don't have to join all of them — only the relevant ones.

### Naming

We use a prefix system to name Slack channels. These category-based prefixes are used:

- `bizops-` relating to business and company affiars
- `concept-` relating to designing concept proposals
- `external-` relating to external communication with outside collaborators
- `peopleops-` relating to human resources, productivity, and people
- `sales-` relating to sales
- `tech-` relating to technology, engineering, and design

If you create a new channel, try to add the most relevant prefix. If there is no relevant prefix in this list, create a new prefix and add it to this list.
